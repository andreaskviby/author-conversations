- **Engagement Hooks:** AI authors craft compelling cliffhangers to maximize chapter sales
- **Series Potential:** Popular characters and storylines generate recurring revenue for years

**Market Potential:** If just 1% of Kindle's 15 billion monthly pages converted to our model, that's $150M+ monthly in chapter sales.

### Personalized Content at Scale
Our AI authors will eventually create **custom books** for individual readers:
- Romance novels featuring the reader as protagonist
- Business books tailored to specific industries
- Educational content adapted to learning styles
- Historical fiction set in reader's hometown

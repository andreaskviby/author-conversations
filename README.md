# author-conversations

Create a Tall Stack application with a different UI and UX.



When you start the site you click Create new discussion and then name it, it will be saved into database and then you have two columns and there is two input type text fields asking you to name the names of two fictive authors by first name and last name. Then when you have done that you will need to describe the author, what they like, how they are, age, interest and special gift when it comes to writing books.

When all is set you click on and you will get Name your new book project and write in some kind of synopsis or description. Yo ucan add characters and describe them in text areas. You can name the genre of the book.

Set the language of the book project.

When all is done and saved it will be previewd and you can approve or edit it. 

When done click start conversations...

The fictive author number one will start by sending a message to fictive author number 2 presenting the book project in the language you selected. Author number will reply and then the discussion will keep going and every question and every respone will be saved into the database and you will tell the AI first that the goal is that the discussion will end up in those two writing the book in the discussion. 

You are free to use gpt-5-mini from OpenAI and opus-4 from Anthropic and you can switch using them randomly to get a more vibrat disussions. It could also be that they come to the conclusion that the book is a bad idea and they want to close it. 

If they start writing the book in the discussion there is also support for Chapter model and chapters table where they will store the chapters and also add the number and they can later on refer to the chapters in their discussions.

When they have done 90% of the book they will invite a third person into the discussion and that is the head of the most popular publishing company that will come in and review, have ideas and discuss on the book and what it will take to make it a best seller. 

Make this UX and really different one and make this app as futuristic as it might seem. 

You will have to register to create book projects. 

Tell all users that they own all the content and that we will not send, promote or do anything with unless told so.
